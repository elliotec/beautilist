Beautilist
======

Beautilist makes list making beautiful.
=====

This app uses a list creation with steps that order themselves. The app is built with Ruby on Rails. We use javascript/jQuery to keep creating lists and the elements on the page and move them around.

Usage
====

1. Name your list and click 'create list'.
2. Add steps to the list.
3. Click the arrow to expand nested steps inside the list.
4. Check the box to hide the step and keep yourself organized moving along the workflow.
5. Click the 'completed' button to complete the list and organize it to the completed part of the page.
