Beautilist makes list making beautiful.
=====

This app uses infinitely nested list creation with the ability to check off lists into a 'completed' section on the page. The app is built with Ruby on Rails. We use javascript/jQuery/ajax to keep creating lists and the elements on the page and move them around ultra dynamically.

Usage
====

1. Name your list and click 'create list'.
2. Nest lists by adding, then editing infinitely. For eternity.
5. Click the 'completed' button to complete the list and organize it to the completed part of the page.
